# Take the columns day1score and day2score, which represent the variable day and the variable score, and 
# gathered them. Why? Remember that tidy data has one column for each variable and one row for each observation. 
# The numbers in the two columns we changed were observations, thus they should each get their own row
tidy2 <- tidyr.ex %>%
  gather(day, score, c(day1score, day2score)) %>%

# Separate a column into two new columns
  separate(col = info, into = c("group", "gender"), sep = 2) %>%
  separate(col = day, into = c("day", "narrative"), sep = 3) %>%
  separate(col = narrative, into = c("day#", "narrative2"), sep = 1)

# Now remove useless columns
  tidy2$day = NULL
  tidy2$narrative2 = NULL
